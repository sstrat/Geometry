# Geometry
Computational geometry GUI
## What is this project?
This project is an GUI (Graphical User Interface) for some of computational gemetry algorithms. It's coded in C++ and for the graphical part I used opengl 3.0 libraries (GLFW AND GLEW).
## Algorithms
- Dijkstra algorithm for Euclidean Shortest Path
- Convex hull
- Domain appartenance
- Minumum distance between 2 two point in a given set
- Area of a convex shape
- The inscribed circle of a triangle
