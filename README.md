# Geometry
Computational geometry GUI
## What is this project?
This project is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for some of computational gemetry algorithms. It's coded in C++ and for the graphical part I used opengl 3.0 libraries (GLFW AND GLEW).
## Algorithms
- Dijkstra algorithm for Euclidean Shortest Path
- Convex hull
- Domain appartenance
- Minumum distance between 2 two point in a given set
- Area of a convex shape
- The inscribed circle of a triangle
## Installation
Clone the project using git clone, or just download the archive and unzip. 
To run this aplication just click on GeoGUI.exe from Geometry/GeoGUI folder or you can open this project in Visual Studio and run it.

## Preview
### Euclidean Shortest Path (Dijkstra)
Given a set of obstacles (2D shapes) and 2 checkpoints (start and finish doesn't matter). Find the shortest path between these two points considering these obstacles.

### Convex Hull
Given a set of points, find the largest convex shape that includes all the points.

## Domain appartenance
You have a set of points, and a convex shape. Find the points that are inside in this shape.
